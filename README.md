The Book Review App allows the user to add a book to a collection of Books and share reviews with other users.  

The app is composed of a client side and the following two mini-microservices:
- *book*: add a book to the book list and retrieves the book list.
- *reviews*: add a review to a particular book and retrieve the review list for each book on the list.

## How to run the app:
  To run the app run the start script `npm start` on the client, book and reviews directories.
  
  The user has to refresh the browser in order to see the book and/or reviews entries.
